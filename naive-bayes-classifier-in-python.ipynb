This will give us the general performance of the ROC curve which consists of the TPR and FPR at various threshold levels. So, an ROC Curve plots TPR vs FPR at different classification threshold levels. If we lower the threshold levels, it may result in more items being classified as positve. It will increase both True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":81,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"image/png":"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
